every day has a rising sun, and one day yours is gonna come and take your blues away. so don't turn away. cause when you're in ninth grade it's a big deal, to stand shoulder to shoulder on a soccer field, with 18 year olds who are too preoccupied to punch you in the gut. yeah these people came for just one thing, to see clay and clint in this human ring, cause both guys were tough as nails, and roughest of the rough. well, clay we didn't know so good cause he grew up outside our neighborhood, but i guess i first heard of him in merry acres middle school. some are just fighters, and clay always was, but he never used a knife or a gun, he preferred to win or get beat on the strength of his will. consequently, clint was notoriously known, for being bit by a rattlesnake in a berry grove, he was only ten then, and he swelled up like a weather balloon. but it couldn't kill him, it only hardened 'em a bit, and after that he never took no stuff, and that' prob'ly why he and clay met that afternoon. so don't turn away, you don't have to run; every day has a rising sun, and one day yours is gonna come and take your blues away. so don't turn away. well, clint and clay should have never a fought, it was a lie that was started by my friends dad's daughter, which would usually be called a sister but she was more than that. cause his dad had an affair with my friend's mom's mother, and had two kids, and maybe others, one was my friends uncle, and the other was his aunt. so his quasi-aunt-step-sister-person had done a bad thing and worsened it, by hitting clay's parked car and starting a lie. she was confused already with the way she was, and she didn't want to piss off the boy she loved, cause she had a crush on clay since she was nine. which was something we didn't quite understand, cause girls dug clay but he was an ugly man, much like us, so he gave us hope, or at least a fighting chance. we just knew he wasn't someone to mess with, so it was no surprise when he got the message, that he skipped his class and ran out in a rage. he yelled, whichever dead man hit my car"," you know what you did and you know who you are"," and if you was worth a damn"," you'd fess up to what you did."," from the group of kids rose a shaking hand"," it was the one of my friend's sister-aunt"," and she said"," clay"," i saw it all and it was clint!"," well"," clint yelled out"," you lyin' inbred! and clay cried"," you little punk"," you're dead!"," you meet me at the y soccer fields a quarter after dark."," clint said"," i didn't hit that piece of crap"," but nobody talks to me like that"," and you're gonna wish you never called me out to that park."," o don't turn away"," you don't have to run;

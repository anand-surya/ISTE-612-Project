parlent de moi mais ne me connaissent meme pas, j'ai pleure un beau jour, 9 heures du mat', 2 mai 81, apres mon frere, ma mere ne pouvait plus enfanter, grace a dieu j'atterris sur terre, mon premier cri pousse, mes premieres larmes versees a la maternite d'l'a belle de mai, issu d'une famille des plus modestes, a la rue parmentier on etait 7 a vivre dans une piece, mon pere travaillait 15 heures par jour et j'le voyais que le soir, le regard marque par le ciment et la routine bref, apres 4 ans passes dans ce taudis, force de demenager vu que la famille s'est agrandie, 143 rue felix piat mon premier meilleur ami, nordine nekka t'inquiete frere jamais je t'oublie, t'etais le premier mec avec qui je volais, apres la classe te casse, on devalisait intermarche, tablette de chocolat crunch, blanco et marqueur, la fine equipe de parc petit debrouillard et tagueurs, bagarreur, apres le foot c'etait la mosquee, basket a 4 bandes trouees on puait des pieds, c'est comme ca que j'ai appris ma premiere sourate, j'm'en rappelle comme hier c'etait avec mon petit frere morad, enfant de marseille insouciant j'ai peur de rien, malgre les roustes a 8 ans j'allais au stade velodrome comme un grand, la vie est rude dans les rues de ma ville, hamdoullah tant que t'as les tiens, ecoute le recit de ma vie, c'est ma vie, ses hauts et ses bas, ils parlent de moi mais ne me connaissent meme pas, c'est ma vie, ses larmes et ses joies, ses rires, ses pleurs, ses peines et ses choix que je ne regrette pas, j'debarque a la savine en 1990, l'annee ou ma mere a accouche du petit dernier, l'equipe est au complet j'ai 4 freres et 4 soeurs, 2 grand freres, 2 grandes soeurs, 2 petits freres et 2 petites soeurs, au milieu de tout ce beau monde legerement privilegie, j'etais ni l'aine ni le dernier, j'trainais avec marco le bagdad, ce genre de pirate qui revenait au quartier avec un poney ou un kart, du college valepin au lycee nord des aminettes, les liens se tissent des qu'on s'attache avec ivresse, perturbateur au fond du cours eleve agite, mais bon toujours premier surtout quand il fallait casser les couilles, famille nombreuse ou le grand frere etait un exemple, juste et ferme, droit et dur, humble et fier, qualites heritees de mes parents emigres, j'les en remercie pour toutes les choses dont ils se sont prives, au fait j'allais zapper mes origines, algerien chaoui de hrenchla c'est pour ca que j'ai la tete dure d'origine, c'est ma vie, ses hauts et ses bas, ils parlent de moi mais ne me connaissent meme pas, c'est ma vie, ses larmes et ses joies, ses rires, ses pleurs, ses peines et ses choix que je ne regrette pas, depuis petit j'suis un reveur, j'observe et je ne parle pas trop, je passe mon temps a delirer, quand j'm'ennuie, je reflechis trop, c'est la que ca se gate tu te poses pleins de questions existentielles, d'autant plus que la puberte s'en mele, a l'ecole ils disent que j'ai des facilites, mais que j'suis pas serieux que j'finirai par me gacher, grace au foot j'ai eu des potes un peu partout a mars, l'epoque des tournois de foot qui reunissait les quartiers en masse, salam a la gavote, malik au plan d'aou, j'reve d'avoir une carriere comme l'enfant prodige d'la castellane, mais bon on n'est pas nes sous la meme etoile, donc j'fais mon chemin et des petits textes apparaissent dans mes toiles, a la savine j'kiffais le rap mais rien de serieux, la morvelle dans le nez j'prends le micro avec les plus vieux, j'etais le seul arabe avec mes freres comoriens, abdou karim ze marteau et d'autres lachent rien, le declic en 9-6 avec le 4-5, j'fais ma premiere rencontre avec alonzo de psy4, 9-8 j'prends mon micro et mon glaive, la rage au micro t'inquietes frere ca sentait la releve, c'est ma vie, ses hauts et ses bas, ils parlent de moi mais ne me connaissent meme pas, c'est ma vie, ses larmes et ses joies, ses rires, ses pleurs, ses peines et ses choix que je ne regrette pas, entre le foot et l'ecole, le rap, la deconne, les mignonnes, les defiles de mode a saint-ferreol, les survets lacoste, la sape et la tchatche, les << je danse le mia >> qu'on faisait peter dans le poste, yeah c'est ca ma vie, l'algerino marseille du parc a la

honneur, je roule sur la route de la vie sur mon fauteuil roulant, souvent les gens me regardent etrangement, j'ai longtemps cru malheureusement que leur jugement est important, je m'appelle salim et j'ai 21 ans, sorti du ventre de ma mere a environ 6 mois et demi, prematurement, des la naissance, une epreuve se met en scene, j'ai a peine vu le jour et je souffre deja d'un manque d'oxygene, erreur medicale ou destin pre-ecrit, en tout cas, les medecins parlent d'une totale paralysie, realite implacable, dur d'accepter ce que je suis, je recherche un coupable, en vain parce qu'il en est ainsi, quand t'es petit tu demandes, pourquoi c'est tombe sur moi, pourquoi moi? pourquoi la vie me foudroie?, tant de questions sans reponses mais l'evidence est la, je ne marcherai surement jamais dans ce monde-la, mais parents souffrent immensement en silence, tentent de le cacher mais dans leurs yeux de la tristesse, de l'impuissance, malheureux de me voir marie a un fauteuil roulant, quand j'y repense, les voir malheureux, c'est peut-etre ma plus grande souffrance, je leur dois tout, tant de sacrifices, ils ont bati leur vie autour de l'handicap de leur fils, j'ai l'impression d'etre un toit pour eux, ils sont tout pour moi, ils m'ont garde avec eux, refuser de me mettre dans un internat, mon quotidien, c'est des journees interminables, passees devant la tele, des heures a gamberger, a se demander qui voudra bien m'amener pour aller chier, ou qui m'aidera a faire des choses simples comme boire ou manger, m'habiller, me deshabiller meme dans la nudite, je suis toujours accompagne, je n'ai pas de jardin secret, les miens sont solidaires, je vis mes epreuves en solitaire, besoin de moments de solitude, la dependance a l'autre me tue, ce qui me tue le plus, c'est la facon dont on me regarde, le miroir de la vie, c'est les gens et l'image qu'ils me renvoient, celle de salim l'handicape qui fait de la peine, s'ils savaient comme je deteste ce regard empreint de peine, je m'appelle salim et j'ai 21 ans, avec force et honneur, je roule sur les routes de la vie sur un fauteuil roulant, souvent les gens me regardent etrangement, j'ai longtemps cru malheureusement que leur jugement est important, je m'appelle salim et j'ai 21 ans, avec force et honneur, je roule sur les routes de la vie sur un fauteuil roulant, souvent les gens me regardent etrangement, j'ai longtemps cru malheureusement que leur jugement est important, dieu m'a dote d'un handicap si je puis dire, m'a donne aussi la force inebranlable de vouloir construire, fonder un foyer, me marier comme une personne valide, voyez-moi, handicap n'est pas une fatalite, les yeux vers le ciel, je reve d'aimer, d'etre aime, mais on ne me voit jamais comme un petit ami potentiel, pas grave, l'espoir fait vivre et le reve le fait durer, impossible et jamais, des mots que je ne prononce jamais, j'ai aime une fille, je l'ai dit a personne meme pas a elle, j'ai pas voulu lui faire porter le poids de ma personne, ma puce si tu te reconnais, je t'aime, je compte plus les fois, ou tu m'as fait oublier mon handicap et mes problemes, je t'inviterais bien a me suivre, viens avec moi, affronter la vie, ses epreuves et ses peripeties, en plus, regarde le bon cote des choses, beaute, j'aurais d'enormes difficultes a te tromper, fermons les yeux, laissons nos coeurs dialoguer, au-dela des apparences, j'ai tant d'amour a te donner, si par malheur tu les ouvrais, c'est que tu ne m'etais pas destinee, en aucun cas je t'en voudrais, sachez, cette chanson n'est pas des larmes, rangez vos mouchoirs, cette chanson n'est pas des larmes, je relate juste des faits, je relate ce que je suis, mon but, c'est que vous m'acceptiez comme je suis, je m'appelle salim et j'ai 21 ans, avec force et honneur, je roule sur les routes de la vie sur un fauteuil roulant, souvent les gens me regardent etrangement, j'ai longtemps cru malheureusement que leur jugement est important, je m'appelle salim et j'ai 21 ans, avec

su carta bianca, tutti parlano e tutti ascoltano, ma la verita dov'e?, in dove vengo o in dove cerco di essere?, non si sradica una rosa uscita dal cemento, scrivi il tuo commento io sono in aereo, se mi hai conosciuto un tempo non sai chi sono adesso, il sorriso di chi ha sofferto, il sospiro di chi poi ha vinto, l'intuito di chi ha poco di nero e in testa gia un impero, per questo il mio nome da rapper e il mio nome vero, paura di perdere, paura di vincere, chi e luche?, la voglia di esprimersi, la voglia emergere, chi e luche?, le urla di un uomo, i momenti di gioia, chi e luche?, cambiarti la vita, rischiando la proprio, chi e luche?, la fine e vicina se inizi a sospettare, tra il dire e il fare c'e di mezzo il mare, c'e di mezzo il rischio di annegare, se raccontarsi ad un amico e mettersi nelle sua mani, il rischio e di affogare, non sono uno che ringrazia, non sono piu tollerante, non sono soggetto a critiche di un ignorante, non sono cio che non sono, so solo, che non sono solo il solo a dire sono solo, voi non siete uniti ovvero non siete forti, credete che dei vostri consigli mi importi, quando passi dall'inserirti all'importi?, la forza di un uomo si vede se piange senza cambiare espressione, pianificando rivoluzione, mettiti nei miei panni e sentiti bello, capirai perche qua tutto mi va stretto, speciale vuol dire raro, incompreso e poi rimpianto, non sono l'ultimo arrivato, saro rimasto, paura di perdere, paura di vincere, chi e luche?, la voglia di esprimersi, la voglia emergere, chi e luche?, le urla di un uomo, i momenti di gioia, chi e luche?, cambiarti la vita, rischiando la proprio, chi e luche?, non sai piu a cosa appartieni quando la tua gente non ti sostiene, io non ti ascolto perche odio le bugie, sai a volte guardo le persone da lontano per vedere cosa fanno quando non sei accanto, provano sempre a rallentarmi, a sminuirmi, meglio agire in silenzio che rispondere apertamente, meglio sorprenderli nel buio che la verita alla luce, non sono prevedibile, non sono underground, non sono commerciale, non sono uguale a nessuno, non sono quello da dissare, non sono quello che si fa influenzare, non sono quello che finito il suo momento non sa come guadagnare, non sono insicuro anche se non sono al sicuro, ma di sicuro, non sono quello che sogna senza avverare, paura di perdere, paura di vincere, chi e luche?, la voglia di esprimersi, la voglia emergere, chi e luche?, le urla di un uomo, i momenti di gioia, chi e luche?, cambiarti la vita, rischiando la proprio, chi e luche?",""
"luche","https://www.azlyrics.com/l/luche.html","lieto fine","https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/luche/lietofine.html","questa e la storia di due angeli dalla pelle scura, denti spezzati, occhi verdi, un'anima pura, un sorriso che sa di rassegnazione, ma non importa, in un mare di palazzi grigi sembra acqua sporca, due caratteri chiusi, ma si piangeva per un film, sognare d'essere i padrini dei nostri figli, persi nei ristoranti sul lungomare, e poi dirgli che e tutto frutto del lavoro duro e del conservare, palazzi abbandonati, buttiamo giu una parete, poi, costruiamo un camino con le sue pietre, cucinare e ubriacarsi fino al mattino, il nostro stomaco urlava piu della gola, passa il vino e lo spino, una peugout rubata, la nostra seconda casa, ci tagliavamo coca e spesso ci si scopava, puzzava d'umido, il finestrino non si chiudeva, guidava lui, lo sterzo pesante non mi piaceva, sempre in cerca di femmine, rispettosi dei gangster, generosi nel spendere, fatti sempre di heineken, mai, scambiati una donna, neanche in un'orgia, gli dissi preoccupato lascia stare quella troia"," il suo ragazzo a giorni esce"," e uno che conta"," sua madre ha letto tutti i suoi messaggi sopra al nokia"," ma non c'e tempo per pensare ne fare una scelta"," dio capira e cambiera tutto alla svelta"," quel giorno entrammo in macchina"," non attiriamo i vigili"," ci fermiamo al rosso come persone civili"," parcheggiamo nel parcheggio della standa"," abbiamo l'alibi della spesa contro i video della banca"," non avevamo ucciso ma conosciamo la prassi"," basta un colpo da vicino e poi via a piccoli passi"," entriamo vestiti tipo agenti tecnocasa"," lui spara in aria mentre prendo i soldi dalla cassa"," la direttrice e sexy e rimasta ferma a fissarmi"," le mandero dei fiori"," un biglietto per perdonarmi"," andiamo via con calma"," un amico poliziotto ha detto"," che abbiamo almeno mezz'ora per farla franca"," ci fermiamo a un bar"," l'adrenalina dopo il rischio"," ci meritiamo almeno un bicchiere di whisky liscio"," lui fa: vieni a casa tra un po ti aspetto per brindare"," c'e una ragazza che ti vogliamo presentare"," ok ne approfitto compro due voli per cipro"," ho voglia di lasciarmi tutto 'sto schifo alla spalle"," forse non per sempre ma almeno per quest'estate"," ma quando arrivo sul posto la sua sorpresa e piu grande:giaceva in un pozzo di sangue insieme alle altre"," una sul divano e l'altra con la testa dentro il water"," non riuscii neanche a dirgli che eravamo al telegiornale"," bagno un fazzoletto nel suo sangue per ricordare. si beve per dimenticare"," si fuma per immaginare"," a cento all'ora su una stradale"," andra come deve andare"," si beve per dimenticare"," si fuma per immaginare"," a cento all'ora su una stradale"," andra come deve andare"," essere nati qua per noi e fonte d'orgoglio anche se"," nascondiamo uno scoglio di coca dentro il portafoglio"," anche se questa terra ci distrugge e noi lo permettiamo"," la sofferenza forse e cio che meritiamo"," ho fatto l'ambulante"," vendevo palloncini in strada"," e approfittavo per guardare una stella se uno volava"," mi accusi di vendermi l'anima per due collane"," vedi il

transizione","https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/luche/latransizione.html","notti indimenticabili con gente di cui non ricordo il nome, ubriachi fino a scordare le offese, ridendo fino a piegare l'addome, con lei che mi ritorna in mente, la mia nuova ragazza e una modella ma non e niente, ed arriviamo facendo rumore, tirando l'attenzione, con vestiti introvabili e pezzi d'autore, il fuoristrada non e mai lo stesso e manda fuori strada, chi ha pensato avessi perso, quando mangi sul mare quello che hanno appena pescato, con la citta davanti, la guardi e resti incantato, e parli di cose inutili di cui non si vive senza, e sedere di fronte ad un ex e solo coincidenza, e chi mi odia e continua ad odiare, e le puttane continuano a posteggiare, e chiamare senza parlare, quindi spendo tutto cio che ho in un paio di dior, per guardare al domani, guardarmi dentro e guardarmi attorno, sai, ricordo tanto tempo fa quando andavamo a vendere le cose col furgone per strada. eravamo costretto a lavarci con una bottiglia d'acqua in tre, dovevamo dividerci l'acqua. e mi ricordo che, sai, nel dietro il furgone loro si facevano, si bucavano. si facevano di eroina e io guidavo la notte per tornare a casa, vivo la mia vita, l'ho vista mentre volo avanti e indietro, ho speso piu tempo in aria che sul terreno, sentivo di essere il piu coraggioso, e che si fotta chi sostiene che sorprendo ogni volta che stendo un testo, come se non avessi scritto la storia, dando a napoli e le sue strade la giusta gloria, se osservi la mia immagine, non dovro spiegare, perche anche quando ho torto riesco a farmi rispettare, voglio urlare, sentire l'eco da una montagna di soldi, chi ama ferire deve sapere incassare i colpi, messo a nudo da luce di riflettori, tu hai vissuto poco se non hai mai fatto errori, la paura che mi sentissi un fallito, per poi finire ad odiare chi ci e riuscito, ma ho due mani quindi due bicchieri, ed ho la faccia di chi ha fame, quindi vieni e brindiamo a chi eri ieri, sai, la citta da cui vengo, napoli, e una citta difficile, io la amo, e la citta che mi ha cresciuto. pero ti fa credere che il successo non sia possibile, e solo uno su un milione ce la fa. invece non e cosi, non devi mai arrenderti, mai piegarti!, soprattutto bisogna difendere un amico quando sbaglia. tutto questo vale poco se non hai qualcuno con cui condividerlo, io ho dovuto viverlo prima di scriverlo, sognavo un team basato sulla lealta, e invece mi sono circondato di crudelta, tu non provi cio che provo, non ti piaccio fino a quando, non piaccio a tutto il globo, fin quando non prendo il volo, fra, rimarro per sempre o rimarro per sempre solo?, ed hanno il coraggio di dirmi che non rido mai, resto calmo perche solo chi ha torto alza la voce, ma quanti chiodi servono per mettermi in croce?, ho cosi tanta tristezza, sono aggrappato al mio passato, ma ogni volta che giro l'angolo sento uno sparo, e cosi facile farsi una pistola se e necessario, non e come nei film, non c'e mai un intermediario, dammi del tempo per ricominciare da capo, ma il tempo qui non aspetta, sa solo metterti fretta",""

without you knowing, without you knowing, right now, in this moment, i think of you without fail, without you knowing, without you knowing, i quietly say it again today, if only it could reach you, if only i could run to you right now, as i blame the situation, saying it can't be helped, i imagine the scene where i face you, words that comfort me, some day, i'll be able to see you again some day, i check your pictures every day, but i pretend to not care when i talk to you, you probably don't know anything, even if you hear this song, it'll just pass, i wanted to be brave so i drank, so i lost my memory, of when we held each other and danced, i didn't want to fall for you anymore, so i stopped talking to you, right now, you might be with someone else, it's selfish but i hope it doesn't turn into something serious, tonight i think of you again, without you knowing, without you knowing, right now, in this moment, i think of you without fail, without you knowing, without you knowing, this song is about you you you you you, but you don't know, this song is about you you you you you, but you don't know, this song is about you you you you you, but you don't know, this song is about you you you you you, but one two three, i used to think that life was too short, to be hung up on someone, but i guess i'm too young to say that, because i know i can't do anything at just one word you said, i want to take down all the walls in your heart, i'm curious about everything in those walls, am i in there at least a little bit?, or is it filled with someone else?, i'll definitely forget you some day, time will pass and this song will remain, i didn't want to throw away this feeling, so i put the lyrics i scribbled down into this place, you are stripping all of me naked, but i'm still not embarrassed, i'll stand proud, but you can't see anything, i'm thinking of you right now, without you knowing, tonight i think of you again, without you knowing, without you knowing, right now, in this moment, i think of you without fail, without you knowing, without you knowing, this song is about you you you you you, but you don't know, this song is about you you you you you, but you don't know, this song is about you you you you you, but you don't know, this song is about you you you you you, but you, i know that my hand can't touch your body, you're too far, i can't project my voice, my greed gets bigger without even knowing, i hope my existence reaches you, i know that my hand can't touch your body, you're too far, i can't project my voice, my greed gets bigger without even knowing, i hope my existence reaches you, tonight i think of you again, without you knowing, without you knowing, right now, in this moment, i think of you without fail, without you knowing, without you knowing, this song is about you you you you you, but you don't know, this song is about you you you you you, but you don't know, this song is about you you you you you, but you don't know, this
